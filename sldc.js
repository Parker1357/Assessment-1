// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

//Planning

//Analysis of Requirements

//Design

//Implementation

//Testing & Integration

//Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "the process of defining user expectations for a new software being built or modified."
const design = "the process of envisioning and defining software solutions to one or more sets of problems." 
const implementation = "transfer the software technical data package  into one or more fabricated, integrated, and tested software configuration items that are ready for software acceptance testing."
const testingAndIntegration = "testing if the software works and if there are any bugs or code that needs to be fixed"
const maintain = "the phase of keeping the software up and running and continuosly checking on it"
